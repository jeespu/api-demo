## API DEMO
### Installation
 1. Clone the repository
 2. Within your cloned repository folder, using a terminal, navigate to the root folder containing the "client" and the "server" folder
 3. In the terminal, type 'npm install' to install [concurrently](https://www.npmjs.com/package/concurrently). This nice little tool allows you to start the client and the server with one command within one terminal.
 4. Type '**npm run stack-install**' to install the required dependencies for both the client and the server
 5. After the installations are done, type '**npm run dev**' to launch both the server and the client. If everything went smoothly, the client will pop open in your browser.
